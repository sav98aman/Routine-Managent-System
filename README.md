# Routine-Managent-System

  The name of this project is Routine Management System. This project has some features like admin can create employee and add routine to employee. Employees can view shift time table and mark as attendance percentage. First of all I made backend part of this project to store employee and admin data in data base to create API to use this service in frontend webpage. In this project i used html, css and javascript for frontend and for frontend i used java, maven, mysql, springboot, spring datajpa using tech stack to create backend service.
